# üçì PFQ-Strawberi
A series of accessibility stylesheets for Pok√©farm Q, accessing key site functions with the click of a single üçì Button.

**Strawberi does not automatically perform actions.** To comply with PFQ TOS (and CSS limitations), the üçì Button reorganizes inputs on the screen using the ::before pseudo-element. It does not and cannot perform inputs on its own. 

*Compatible with PFQ as of 4/2/24. QOL script recommended.*

*Cannot be used for PFNext or any other PokeFarm service.*

*Tested on Firefox.*

1. Access the Site Skins page at https://pokefarm.com/skin.
2. Paste the contents of the release file(s) into the "Extra CSS" section of the Skin Editor.
3. **OR** use the integrated site skin by pasting **JPM4/strawberi** into the "Other Skin" path.
