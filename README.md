## Q&A

### Q: How does Strawberi's Field Module compare to [Winterbraid's One Click Fields](https://pfq.link/~Mzx6)?
A: It's a different implementation.
- OCF is developed for Chrome;
- Strawberi is developed for Firefox.
- OCF is lightweight and standalone;
- Strawberi covers most of the site.
- OCF uses precise CSS selectors;
- Strawberi is designed to be scalable.
- OCF can be toggled with the QOL script;
- Strawberi cannot.

Use whichever one works better for you.

### Q: Will there be a Garden Module?
A: No, due to CSS limitations. For a practical solution, see [Neonyan's Easy Garden Watering](https://pfq.link/~V9yD).

### Q: Are you worried about releasing this during the PFQ Recode?
A: Not really. If the HTML changes, Strawberi will be updated accordingly.
